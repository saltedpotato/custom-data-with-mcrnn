This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects** for object detection.\n","\n","It is worth noting that the Detectron2 library goes far beyond object detection, supporting semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, mask, and densepose.\n","\n","\n","### Accompanying Blog Post\n","\n","We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [how to train Detectron2](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-detectron2/), concurrently.\n","\n","### Steps Covered in this Tutorial\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to train Detectron2 on your custom objects. We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data.\n","\n","To train our detector we take the following steps:\n","\n","* Install Detectron2 dependencies\n","* Prepare custom Detectron2 object detection data\n","* Visualize Detectron2 training data\n","* Write our Detectron2 Training configuration\n","* Run Detectron2 training\n","* Evaluate Detectron2 performance\n","* Run Detectron2 inference on test images\n","\n","\n","\n","### **About Roboflow**\n","\n","[Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai) enables teams to deploy custom computer vision models quickly and accurately. Convert data from to annotation format, assess dataset health, preprocess, augment, and more.
